###Scope
The goal was to create an app where users could create comic stories using photos taken from the camera or the user's photo library. Every story has a minimum of 2 pages and a maximum of 6. After adding an image the user can add transformable stickers and drawings to their pages. All changes are auto saved with core data and can be viewed in a slideshow afterwards.

Out of scope features (may be added on future releases) include:
Ability to delete stories
Share stories between devices
Share stories on social media sites
